Hi Eric!

You can start this app by entering the client folder and running 'npm start'. Next enter the backend folder and run 'npm run dev'.

Then, once you are running the app on a local server you can log in using google or facebook. Once you are logged in you will notice all of the relevant work that I need to complete before moving on is in the 'Me' tab of the nav bar. There, you'll find a form that doesn't completely work as of the moment.

The form does not update properly. I still have a couple of hours before I have this dialed in. I'd like to give people the option to create a profile as an individual or a larger business entity.

The API is built using an MVC framework. I scaffolded out some models and controller files that aren't in use yet.

There are definitely some bugs just entering basic profile information right now but hopefully you can start stepping through the source code and get a feel for what I'm doing.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
